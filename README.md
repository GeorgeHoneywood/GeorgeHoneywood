### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Royal Holloway, currently working as in Infrastructure Assistant at GSA Capital in London.

As part of my degree, I completed a Year in Industry placement as a Junior Software Engineer, for Cudo, in Bournemouth. 

While at Cudo I mostly worked on their Node.js API, but did quite a lot of frontend work in Vue too. I also helped develop their first Go based microservice â€” Go is now probably my favourite language.

Previously I've worked as a Junior Systems Administrator in the Royal Holloway Particle Physics Department, where I helped to monitor and manage their compute and storage clusters (200+ nodes).

When I'm not working I like to spend time contributing to OpenStreetMap, or getting lost in the countryside. I am a big fan of FOSS, and help out where I can!
