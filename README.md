### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student at Royal Holloway, mostly interested in DevOps and backend. I am currently completing my Year in Industry as a Junior Software Engineer at Cudo in Bournemouth.

I've previously worked as a Junior Systems Administrator in the Royal Holloway Particle Physics Department, where I helped to monitor and manage their compute and storage clusters (200+ nodes).

When I'm not working I like to spend time contributing to OpenStreetMap, or getting lost in the countryside.
