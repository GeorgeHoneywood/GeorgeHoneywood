### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student at Royal Holloway, mostly interested in backend. I am now in my final year, after completing a Year in Industry as a Junior Software Engineer for Cudo in Bournemouth. 

While at Cudo I mostly worked on their Node.js API, but did quite a lot of frontend work in Vue too. I also helped develop their first Go based microservice â€” Go is now probably my favourite language. Previously I've worked as a Junior Systems Administrator in the Royal Holloway Particle Physics Department, where I helped to monitor and manage their compute and storage clusters (200+ nodes).

When I'm not working I like to spend time contributing to OpenStreetMap, or getting lost in the countryside. I am a big fan of FOSS, and like to help out where I can!
